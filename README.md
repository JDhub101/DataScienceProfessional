#### Copy of Python Code:

Here is the python code I used in a juypter notebook in Visual Studio Code Editor:

```
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import os
  import seaborn as sns
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  
  file_path = 'car_data.xlsx'
  df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name='data')
```
